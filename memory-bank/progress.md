# Progress: VoiceInputter

## What Works
- **Audio Capture:** Continuous monitoring with `sounddevice`.
- **VAD:** Silence detection (Auto-Stop) and Voice Trigger (Auto-Start).
- **Backend:** ComfyUI integration (Upload, Queue, WebSocket).
- **UI:** Persistent overlay with status (Ready/Recording/Processing).
- **Controls:** Manual Record/Stop buttons, VAD toggles.
- **Output:** Auto-paste + Enter.

## What's Left to Build
- **Refactoring:** Modularize codebase.
- **UI Enhancements:** Draggable window, Text Edit Area.
- **Control Enhancements:** Auto-Send/Auto-Enter toggles.
- **Packaging:** Standalone executable.

## Current Status
The tool is fully functional with advanced VAD features. We are now focusing on UX improvements and code maintainability.

## Known Issues
- None.
